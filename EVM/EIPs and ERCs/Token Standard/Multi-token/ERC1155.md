# ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard

**Overview:**

ERC1155 allows managing multiple token types (fungible and non-fungible) within a single contract, offering improved efficiency over separate ERC20 or ERC721 contracts.

### Core Components

1. **Token Identification**:
    - Each token type has a unique `uint256` identifier.
    - A single ID can represent either fungible or non-fungible tokens.
2. **Balance Tracking**:
    - Mapping: `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;`
    - Tracks balances of each token type for each address.
3. **Approval System**:
    - Operator approval: `mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;`
4. Total Supply of each token ID:
    - Total supply of each token ID: `mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _totalSupply;`

### Core Functions

1. `balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) → uint256`
2. `balanceOfBatch(address[] accounts, uint256[] ids) → uint256[]`
3. `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`
4. `isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) → bool`
5. `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data)`
6. `safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`

### Token Minting (Internal)

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

### Batch Operations

ERC1155 supports efficient batch operations:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(address to, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");
    require(ids.length == amounts.length, "ERC1155: ids and amounts length mismatch");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        _balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);

    _doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

### URI for Metadata

```solidity
function uri(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string memory) {
    return _uris[id];
}
```

### Uniqueness and Fungibility

- Single contract manages both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
- Token IDs determine uniqueness:
    - Fungible tokens: Multiple tokens can share an ID.
    - Non-fungible tokens: Each token has a unique ID with a total supply of 1.

### Differences from ERC721

1. **Multiple Token Types**: Manages multiple token types in one contract.
2. **Batch Operations**: Native support for efficient batch transfers and queries.
3. **Fungibility**: Supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
4. **Approval System**: Uses operator approvals instead of per-token approvals.
5. **Gas Efficiency**: Generally more gas-efficient for large numbers of token types.

### Key Differences: ERC1155 vs ERC1155 Upgradeable

Differences between standard ERC1155 and ERC1155Upgradeable:

**Storage Pattern:**

```solidity
// ERC1155Upgradeable uses a specific storage pattern to avoid collisions
struct ERC1155Storage {
    mapping(uint256 id => mapping(address account => uint256)) _balances;
    mapping(address account => mapping(address operator => bool)) _operatorApprovals;
    string _uri;
}
```

```solidity
// Custom storage slot for upgrades
bytes32 private constant ERC1155StorageLocation = 0x88be536d5240c274a3b1d3a1be54482fd9caa294f08c62a7cde569f49a3c4500;

function _getERC1155Storage() private pure returns (ERC1155Storage storage $) {
    assembly {
        $.slot := ERC1155StorageLocation
    }
}
```

**Initialization Instead of Constructor:**

```solidity
// ERC1155Upgradeable uses initializer
function __ERC1155_init(string memory uri_) internal onlyInitializing {
    __ERC1155_init_unchained(uri_);
}

// Normal ERC1155 uses constructor
constructor(string memory uri_) {
    _setURI(uri_);
}
```

### The main differences are:

**Storage Layout:**

- `ERC1155Upgradeable` uses a specific storage location through `ERC1155StorageLocation`
- Normal ERC1155 declares storage variables directly in the contract
- This prevents storage collisions during upgrades


**Initialization:**

- ERC1155Upgradeable uses `initializer` pattern
- Regular ERC1155 uses constructors
- This allows the contract to be properly initialized after being deployed behind a proxy

**Inheritance:**

- `ERC1155Upgradeable` inherits from `Initializable`
- Uses `ContextUpgradeable` instead of Context
- Uses `ERC165Upgradeable` instead of ERC165

**Storage Access:**

```solidity
// Upgradeable version - uses storage pointer
function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    ERC1155Storage storage $ = _getERC1155Storage();
    return $._balances[id][account];
}

// Normal version - direct storage access
function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    return _balances[id][account];
}
```

**The purpose of these changes is to:**

- Make the contract safely upgradeable
- Prevent storage collisions
- Allow proper initialization after proxy deployment
- Maintain consistent storage layout across upgrades

This pattern makes ERC1155Upgradeable suitable for use with proxy patterns and upgrades, while the normal ERC1155 is for non-upgradeable implementations.
