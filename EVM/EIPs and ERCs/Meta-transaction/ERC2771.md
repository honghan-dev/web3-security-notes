# ERC-2771 **Secure Protocol for Native Meta Transactions**

## Overview

- ERC-2771 defines a standard contract interface for receiving **meta transactions** through trusted forwarder contracts
- This EIP defines a contract-level protocol for `Recipient` contracts to accept meta-transactions through trusted `Forwarder` contracts. No protocol changes are made. `Recipient` contracts are sent the effective `msg.sender` (referred to as `_msgSender()`) and `msg.data` (referred to as `_msgData()`) by appending additional calldata.

- [EIP-1271: Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts](https://www.notion.so/ERC1271-Standard-Signature-Validation-Method-for-Contracts-1306172cb8b180ed9c7adc3ab6b3c437?pvs=21)

## Why It Exists

- Allow users to interact with smart contracts without holding ETH for gas
- Enable third parties (relayers) to pay for gas on behalf of users
- Standardize how contracts handle meta transactions securely

## Key Components

### 1. Core Actors

- **Transaction Signer**: End user who signs the transaction but doesn't pay gas
- **Gas Relay**: Third party that pays gas and forwards signed transactions
- **Trusted Forwarder**: Smart contract that verifies signatures before forwarding
- **Recipient**: Contract that accepts and processes meta transactions

### 2. Required Interface

```solidity
interface IERC2771Recipient {
    function isTrustedForwarder(address forwarder)
        external
        view
        returns (bool);
}
```

### 3. Internal Implementation

```solidity
// Calldata structure for meta transaction signature
[function signature][parameters][sender address (20 bytes)]

contract ERC2771Recipient {
    address immutable _trustedForwarder;

    function _msgSender() internal view returns (address sender) {
        if (msg.sender == _trustedForwarder) {
						// Extract original sender from the last 20 bytes of calldata
            assembly {
                sender := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))
            }
            return sender;
        }
        return msg.sender;
    }
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Transaction Flow

```
User (signs tx) → Gas Relay (pays gas) → Trusted Forwarder → Recipient Contract
```

### 2. Data Structure

```solidity
struct MetaTransaction {
    address from;// Original signer
    bytes functionData;// Function to call
    uint256 nonce;// Prevent replay attacks// Additional fields based on implementation
}
```

### 3. Security Measures

- Trusted forwarder verification
- Nonce tracking for replay protection
- Signature validation
- Original sender address verification

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**
    - No ETH needed for gas
    - Simpler onboarding
    - Better UX for dApps
2. **Developer Experience**
    - Standardized interface
    - Clear security model
    - Easy to implement
3. **Flexibility**
    - Works with any EVM contract
    - Compatible with various signature schemes
    - Supports different forwarding models

## Common Use Cases

1. **DeFi Applications**
    - Gasless token approvals
    - Sponsored transactions
    - Batch operations
2. **NFT Platforms**
    - Free minting
    - Gasless transfers
    - Marketplace interactions
3. **Gaming dApps**
    - In-game transactions
    - Asset transfers
    - Player actions

## Implementation Example

```solidity
contract MyContract is ERC2771Recipient {
    constructor(address trustedForwarder) {
        _trustedForwarder = trustedForwarder;
    }

    function doSomething() external {
				// Use _msgSender() instead of msg.sender
        address realSender = _msgSender();
				// Rest of the logic
    }

    function isTrustedForwarder(address forwarder)
        public
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        return forwarder == _trustedForwarder;
    }
}

```

## Security Considerations

1. **Forwarder Trust**
    - Carefully select trusted forwarders
    - Consider immutable forwarder addresses
    - Verify forwarder implementation
2. **Signature Validation**
    - Proper nonce management
    - Secure signature verification
    - Prevention of replay attacks
3. **Data Integrity**
    - Validate appended sender address
    - Check calldata length
    - Verify function parameters

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**
    - Always verify trusted forwarder
    - Use _msgSender() consistently
    - Implement proper nonce tracking
2. **Integration**
    - Test meta transactions thoroughly
    - Document trusted forwarders
    - Validate all security assumptions
3. **Maintenance**
    - Monitor forwarder contracts
    - Update security parameters
    - Track nonce management
