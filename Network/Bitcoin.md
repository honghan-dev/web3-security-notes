# 🧱 What’s Inside a Bitcoin Block?

Every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin block is born — the heartbeat of the Bitcoin network. But what exactly is inside one of these blocks? Let’s crack it open and explore both the **header** and the **payload**.

---

## 🔗 The Block Header — The DNA of Bitcoin

The block header is like a block’s ID card. It's just **80 bytes**, but it contains everything needed to:

- Link the block to its parent
- Prove its legitimacy
- Enable mining and consensus

### 🧩 Block Header Structure

| Field                 | Size      | Description |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `version`            | 4 bytes   | Signals block validation rules |
| `previous_block_hash`| 32 bytes  | Hash of the parent block (ensures chaining) |
| `merkle_root`        | 32 bytes  | Root hash of all transactions in the block |
| `timestamp`          | 4 bytes   | Time when block was mined |
| `bits`               | 4 bytes   | Current network difficulty (compact format) |
| `nonce`              | 4 bytes   | Value miners adjust to solve the proof-of-work puzzle |

🔐 **Fun Fact**: Miners repeatedly change the nonce to find a block hash that's below the difficulty target defined by `bits`.

## 📦 The Block Body — Where the Real Action Happens

The body contains what matters most: **transactions**. These define who sent how much BTC to whom.

### 📝 Transaction Count

- A variable-length integer (`varint`) that tells how many transactions are inside.

### 🔄 Transactions (txs)

Each transaction is a mini-program that transfers BTC. It contains:

- **Inputs**: Where the BTC is coming from (referencing earlier outputs)
- **Outputs**: Where the BTC is going (and how it can be spent)
- **Signatures**: To prove the sender owns the funds

---

### 🧨 OP_RETURN — Hiding Messages in the Blockchain

One unique type of transaction output uses `OP_RETURN`.

#### ✳️ What’s OP_RETURN?

- A special script opcode used in an output’s `scriptPubKey`
- Makes the output **provably unspendable**
- Used to embed data (like hashes, messages, NFTs, timestamps)
- 🛑 OP_RETURN outputs do not transfer BTC. They're used to carry metadata, not money.

#### 🧠 Example

```text
Output = {
  value: 0,
  scriptPubKey: "OP_RETURN 48656c6c6f20576f726c64"
}
```

That hex string? It says `Hello World` — forever etched into the blockchain.

### 🔁 The Coinbase Transaction — Paying the Miners

The first transaction in every block is the coinbase transaction, which:

- Has no inputs

- Mints new BTC (the block reward + fees)

- Pays the miner for securing the network

- 💰 This is how new Bitcoin enters circulation.

### 🧠 TL;DR — Anatomy of a Bitcoin Block

```rust
Block
├── Header (80 bytes)
│   ├── Version
│   ├── Previous Block Hash
│   ├── Merkle Root
│   ├── Timestamp
│   ├── Difficulty (bits)
│   └── Nonce
└── Body
    ├── Transaction Count
    └── Transactions
        ├── Coinbase Tx (reward)
        ├── Standard Tx(s)
        └── Optional OP_RETURN data
```

## 👁 Final Thoughts

A Bitcoin block isn't just a chunk of data — it’s a cryptographically linked, timestamped container of financial truth. Every transaction tells a story, and every block is a chapter in the open, immutable ledger we call the blockchain.

Whether you're a miner, developer, or just a curious explorer — understanding the internals of a block brings you one step closer to the foundations of Bitcoin.
