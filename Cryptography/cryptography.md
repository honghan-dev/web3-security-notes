# üõ°Ô∏è Cryptography in Modern Blockchains

## 1. BLS (Boneh‚ÄìLynn‚ÄìShacham) Signatures

A pairing-based signature scheme that supports signature aggregation ‚Äî allowing multiple signatures to be combined into one.

This is especially useful in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, where many validators sign the same message (e.g., block attestations).

BLS is typically used with the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, which offers strong 128-bit security and efficient pairing operations.

### Used in

BLS12-381 + BLS ‚Äî Ethereum 2.0 (validators), Chia, Filecoin

### Data structure

```rust
BLS Private Key: 32 bytes (256 bits)
BLS Public Key:  96 bytes (768 bits) - this is what goes in the contract

Example:
private_key = 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
public_key  = 0x123abc...def (96 bytes total)

# Generate BLS keypair example
validator-keygen --num-validators 1 --chain mainnet
```

## 2. User Transaction Signatures

Most user-level (EOA) transactions prioritize speed, simplicity, and wide compatibility.

**ECDSA (secp256k1)**

- Used in Bitcoin, Ethereum (Layer 1), and many EVM-compatible chains.
- Known for efficiency and broad hardware/software support.

**Ed25519**

- A modern signature scheme based on twisted Edwards curves.
- Deterministic and faster to verify, with smaller keys and signatures.
- Popular in networks like Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Tezos.

### Used in

ECDSA (secp256k1) ‚Äî Bitcoin, Ethereum (EOAs)

Ed25519 ‚Äî Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, Tezos
