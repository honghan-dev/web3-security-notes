# ERC-7528 ETH Native Asset Address Convention

**Overview:**

ERC-7528 proposes using `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` (checksummed) as the standard address to represent ETH when it's used in contexts typically expecting ERC-20 tokens.

## Core Specification

### Standard Address

```solidity
0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee// Non-checksummed
0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE// EIP-155 checksummed
```

### Requirements

1. **Must Use**: When representing ETH in ERC-20 contexts
2. **Must Not Use**: For wrapped versions of ETH (e.g., WETH)
3. **Checksum**: Should use EIP-155 checksummed version where appropriate

## Use Cases

### 1. Event Emissions

- Single event format for both ETH and ERC-20 transfers
- Reduced data fragmentation
- Simplified off-chain infrastructure

### 2. ERC-4626 Integration

- LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) using ETH as asset
- Standardized vault implementations
- Unified tooling support

### 3. Protocol Integration

- Consistent token handling interface
- Simplified protocol development
- Better interoperability

## Design Rationale

### Why This Address?

1. **Distinctive Pattern**: Easy visual recognition
2. **No Collisions**: Avoids precompile address conflicts
3. **Existing Usage**: Most widely adopted format
4. **Universal**: Applies to all EVM chains

### Alternatives Considered

- `0x0`: Potential precompile collision
- `0x1`: Potential precompile collision
- `0xe`: Less distinctive, potential conflicts

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Risks**
    - Native ETH transfers can be reentrant
    - Must follow checks-effects-interactions pattern
    - Different security model from ERC-20s
2. **Implementation Guidelines**
    - Careful handling of ETH transfers
    - Proper validation checks
    - Gas considerations
