# EIP-150: Gas Cost Changes for IO-Heavy Operations

---

## Key Changes

1. **63/64 Rule**: Only 63/64 (about 98.4%) of the remaining gas is forwarded when a contract calls another contract. The calling contract retains 1/64 of the gas.
2. **Increased Gas Costs**: The gas costs for certain opcodes were increased:
    - EXTCODESIZE: from 20 to 700
    - EXTCODECOPY: from 20 to 700
    - BALANCE: from 20 to 400
    - SLOAD: from 50 to 200
    - CALL, DELEGATECALL, CALLCODE: from 40 to 700
    - SELFDESTRUCT: from 0 to 5000
3. **Dynamic Gas Cost for SSTORE**: The gas cost for SSTORE (storage write) was made dynamic based on whether it's setting a zero value to non-zero (20,000 gas) or changing an existing non-zero value (5,000 gas).

## Vulnerabilities Prevented

1. **Call Depth Attack**: The 63/64 rule effectively prevents call depth attacks by ensuring that nested calls eventually run out of gas, limiting the maximum call depth.
2. **DOS Attacks**: By increasing the cost of IO-heavy operations, EIP-150 made it more expensive to perform denial-of-service attacks that relied on cheap access to external contract data or state.
3. **Spam Attacks**: The increased cost of CALL and related opcodes made it more expensive to spam the network with numerous contract calls.
4. **State-Bloat Attacks**: The dynamic cost for SSTORE discouraged unnecessary state changes and incentivized zeroing out storage slots when no longer needed.

## Vulnerabilities Created

While EIP-150 primarily addressed vulnerabilities, it did introduce some considerations:

1. **Unexpected Out-of-Gas Errors**: Contracts designed before EIP-150 might unexpectedly run out of gas due to the 63/64 rule, especially in deeply nested calls.
2. **Increased Transaction Costs**: The higher gas costs for certain operations increased the overall cost of transactions, potentially affecting some dApp designs.
3. **Contract Size Limitations**: The increased cost of EXTCODESIZE and EXTCODECOPY made it more expensive to work with large contracts, indirectly encouraging smaller, modular contract designs.

## Impact on Smart Contract Development

1. **Gas Optimization**: Developers must be more conscious of gas costs, especially for IO-heavy operations.
2. **Call Depth Awareness**: Contracts had to be designed with the 63/64 rule, avoiding deep call chains.
3. **Storage Efficiency**: The dynamic SSTORE cost encouraged more efficient use of storage, promoting patterns like "delete" to reclaim gas.
4. **External Calls Caution**: The increased cost of external calls (CALL, DELEGATECALL) promoted the more careful design of inter-contract interactions.
