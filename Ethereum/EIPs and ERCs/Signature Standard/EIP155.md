# EIP-155: Simple Replay Attack Protection

**Overview**
`EIP-155` prevents replay attacks by making transactions network-specific. It adds a unique Chain ID to each transaction signature, so transactions signed for one network (like mainnet) cannot be replayed on another network (like testnets).

## Key Features

**Chain ID System**

- Each network has a unique `Chain ID (Ethereum mainnet = 1)`
- `Chain ID` is included when creating transaction signatures
- Transactions are locked to their intended network

**How It Works**

New signature format includes `Chain ID`
Legacy signatures still work for backward compatibility
Implemented in Spurious Dragon hard fork at block 2,675,000

**Requirements**

Transactions must include Chain ID in signature calculation
New `v` value formula: `Chain ID * 2 + 35 + {0,1}`
Must support both new and old signature formats

**Example**
A simple transaction on Ethereum mainnet (Chain ID = 1):

`Before EIP-155`: v value would be 27 or 28
`After EIP-155`: v value becomes 37 or 38 (includes Chain ID)
`Result`: Transaction only works on mainnet, not other networks

**Benefits**

Prevents replay attacks: Transactions can't be copied between networks
Network isolation: Keeps mainnet, testnet, and private chains separate
Backward compatible: Old transactions still work
Future-proof: New networks get unique IDs

Common Chain IDs

```solidity
1 - Ethereum mainnet
3 - Ropsten testnet
4 - Rinkeby testnet
5 - Goerli testnet
1337 - Private chains (default)
```

### Before vs After EIP-155

**Before (Vulnerable)**

- Same signature worked on all networks
- Transactions could be replayed across chains
- No network identification

**After (Protected)**

- Signatures tied to specific Chain ID
- Transactions only work on intended network
- Automatic replay protection
