# ERC6909 Minimal Multi-token interface

ERC6909 is a minimal multi-token standard designed for efficiency and flexibility. It allows for managing multiple token types within a single contract, similar to ERC1155, but with a more streamlined approach.

## Core Components

1. **Token Identification**:
    - Each token type has a unique `uint256` identifier.
    - Can represent both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
2. **Balance Tracking**:
    - Mapping: `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;`
    - Tracks balances of each token type for each address.
3. **Approval System**:
    - Operator approval: `mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;`
    - Token-specific allowances: `mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256))) private _allowances;`

## Core Functions

1. `balanceOf(address owner, uint256 id) → uint256`
2. `allowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 id) → uint256`
3. `transfer(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) → bool`
4. `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) → bool`
5. `approve(address spender, uint256 id, uint256 amount) → bool`
6. `setOperator(address operator, bool approved) → bool`
7. `isOperator(address owner, address operator) → bool`

### Uniqueness and Fungibility

- A single contract manages both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
- Token IDs determine uniqueness:
    - Fungible tokens: Multiple tokens can share an ID.
    - Non-fungible tokens: Each token has a unique ID with a total supply of 1.

### Key Differences from ERC1155

1. **Simplicity**: More minimal design, focusing on core functionality.
2. **Approval System**: Includes both operator and token-specific approvals.
3. **Transfer Functions**: Separate `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions (similar to ERC20).
4. **No Mandatory Safety Checks**: Does not require checks for contract recipients.
5. **No Batch Operations**: Batch functions not included in the standard.
6. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for lower gas costs in basic operations.
7. **Flexibility**: Provides more room for custom implementations.
